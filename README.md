1st program to add two numbers 
   #include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

    // Step 1: Define variables (Thinking: What data do we need?)
    int number1 = 10;
    int number2 = 20;
    
    // Step 2: Perform addition (Thinking: What operation solves our problem?)
    int sum = number1 + number2;
    
    // Step 3: Display result (Thinking: How do we show the solution?)
    cout << "The sum of " << number1 << " and " << number2 << " is: " << sum << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
